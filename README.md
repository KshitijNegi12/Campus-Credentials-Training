# CRT Bootcamp Training Repository
This repository contains all the code and exercises from the Campus Recruitment Training (CRT) Bootcamp. The bootcamp was designed to prepare students for coding interviews, technical assessments, and real-world programming challenges. It covers a range of topics including object-oriented programming (OOP), Python, data structures, and interview tips.


The CRT Bootcamp was an intensive 10-day training session focusing on the skills and concepts essential for campus recruitment processes. This repository serves as a resource to revisit the codes and problems solved during the bootcamp, which include algorithm practice, Python programming exercises, OOP concepts, and interview-style questions.

## Topics Covered
During the CRT bootcamp, the following major topics were covered:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
  - Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction
  - Hands-on coding examples in Python
- **Python Programming:**
  - Basic and advanced Python syntax
  - Python libraries for data manipulation and problem-solving
- **Data Structures:**
  - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and more
  - Implementation and use cases of each data structure
- **Algorithmic Problem Solving:**
  - Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming
  - Solving coding problems on platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces
- **Interview Preparation:**
  - Coding interview tips and techniques
  - Mock interview questions and solutions
